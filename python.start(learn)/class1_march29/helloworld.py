print("Hello World!")
"""
This is a print command. Print outputs whatever is within the () to the terminal/shell.

"Hello World!" is a string. A string is a datatype in python. It contains all alphanumerical and special characters one
can think of. They just need to be included within the "" so that the python interpreter ignores it (doesn' treat it 
like a number, a command, or anything else)
"""

myfirstvariable = "my var"
"""
This is a variable. Variables are ways of storing information in the python program. If you were be playing a videogame,
a variable would hold your level, points, health, etc.

To define a variable, just type the variable name(make sure it is descriptive), put an '=' operator, and type what you
want it to be defined to.
"""

first_int = 3
second_int = 5

"""
Here we defined the variables as integers. Integers are any number(both positive and negative) that don't have a frac-
tional endings, e.g. 3, 68739, -7, -439648. These numbers aren't integers: 10.5, %500, -3 1/4
"""

sumofints = first_int + second_int
"""
Here we assigned the sum of two other variable to our variable 'sumofints'. The python operators are '+' for addition,
'-' for subtraction, '*' for division, '/' for multiplication. You can operate on any numbers, including variables 
which have been assigned numbers.
"""

print(first_int)
print(second_int)
print(sumofints)

print("This is my first variable: ", myfirstvariable)
"""
Here we have a print statement outputting two types of data: a string, and a variable. TO do this, you need to seperate
the two by a comma ','.
